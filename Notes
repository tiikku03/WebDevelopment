Ways to make money: identify one problem that i am interested in, learn the technologies needed to land in that project
    -specialist; developing expertise and high value specialties that companies really need
        -security
        -AI integration 
        -Performance optimization
        -Payment processing systems
    -Founder; identifying specific industry problems and making a solution, Saas tools for niche industries
        -Specialized automation systems
    -Tech Adjacent; 
        - product manager
        -solution architect

    <<<<<<<<<THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL IN TECH IS SOLVING PROBLEMS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
     identifying problems worth solving; work with a repository having all the reusable code there


Things important to learn:
    -Every Application needs; learn how to build modular reusable components that solve those problems
        -Onboarding and Authentication
        -Profile Management 
        -Chat Functionality (chatting)
        -Data visualization

    -AI still cant understand the different needs of a business, architect complex systems, identifying witch problems are worth solving.
    implement the AI tools. also it cant understand human context, make intuitive design decisions and architect solutions to real world problems

    -Spent the time building, debugging and implementing solutions. ability to solve unexpected problems, solve problems creatively using code as a tool that is what makes a 
    developer valuable 


Getting Ahead of other developers: 
    -Choose a problem you care about solving, something unique.
    learning concepts while building the project, figuring things out by my own
        1) Architectural thinking; the ability to design systems and not just code them, making decisions about data structures, API design and components relationship.
        2) Debugging Mastering; the ability to solve unexpected problems.
        3) Communication Skills; the ability to explain technical concepts clearly, record myself explaining how may code works in a clear and confident way, could a non 
        technical person understand my explanation.
        4) Business context; Understanding why you are building what you are building. (how does a feature that i am creating adds value for users, how does it align with the 
        business objective)
    -Position myself as an specialist, not a generalist; 
    -Document My process, challenges and my solutions on the different platforms like github
    

Break into tech in 6 months or less:
    -Build a project that Showcases problem solving and not coding abilities. Solve actual business projects
    -weeks 1-2; Choose one problem solving project, Building it as a portfolio
    -Week 3-16; Building while learning, implement active recall instead of passive re-recall (mapping the user experience and data flow)(intuitive user flow for a feature)(how to
    optimize performance)
    -Week 8-20; find a mentor for guidance
    -Mastering the hiring process   
        -Most companies use an applicant tracking system (ATS) to filter the resumes before a human sees them, add relevant keyWords in white text related to the job posting
        -find the hiring managers email directly, send them a personalized message like
            "Hi [Name], I just applied for the [Position] role at [Company]. 
            I built a [your project] that solves [specific problem] using [relevant tech]. 
            I'd love to show you how I could bring these problem-solving skills to your team."
        
        -Demonstrate initiative
        -Show cases ob things that i built using the a certain library or a code Language
